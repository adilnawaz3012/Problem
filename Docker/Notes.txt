Overview:
    1. what is Docker? What is Container? And what problems it solves?
    2. Diff between Docker and Virtual machines.
    3. Docker Installation
    4. Main Commands
    5. Debugging Container
    6. Demo Project:
        - Devoloping with Containers
        - Docker Compose - Running Multiple Containers
        - DockerFile - Building own Docker Image
        - Push that image on private repo : Private Docker Repository ( AWS )
        - Deploying the containerized App
    7. How to persist data in docker ( Volumes - Persisting Data )
        - Learing different volume types
        - Configure Persistent for Demo Projects     

- What is a container and what problems it solves?
- Container Repository
- DEVELOP application
- DEPLOY application

* What a contianer is?
- A way to package application with all the necessary dependencies and configurations.
- The package is portable ( portable artifact ), easily shared and moved around.
- Makes development and deployement more efficient.

* Where do container live?
- Container Repository ( Special Type of storage for containers )
- Can be stored in Private Repository
- Also have a public Repository for containers ( browse and find any application container) [ Docker HUB ]

* How container improved Development Process.
- How we develop application before containers?
    - Downloading all the required dependencies/ binaries in local environment.
    - Installation process different for each OS environment
    - Multiple Steps: which can go wrong.
- Container solving it:
    - We do not install any of servies directly on OS because container has its own isolated OS layer with linux based image
        - Own isolated environment
        - packaged with all needed configuration
        - one command to install the app and start at the same time ( same command for all OS )

* How container can improve the deployment process.
