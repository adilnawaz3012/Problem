/*
Disconnected graph with 3 components
EVen a single node can be called as an component
NOTE: Whatever code we write, we need to write for multiple components

1. take a visited array in order to write code for multiple components
2. size fo visited array will be equal to number of nodes.
3. Initialy all the visited index will be 0 initially

For 1 based index graph

for(int i=1;i<=n;i++) {
    if(not_visited[i]) {
        either dfs
        or bfs
    }
}
